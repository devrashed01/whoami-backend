### whoami-backend

_*whoami-backend* is node js backend to provide some information to my personal portfolio. it's a public repo- anyone can use this codebase, but it's not professionally structured as I am doing this for my small need, therefor I will not recommend using this, though you can update it yourself.

#### *here is the frontend- work in progress*: [**whoami-rashed**](https://whoami-rashed.vercel.app/)
